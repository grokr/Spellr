# Spellr
Deep learning based Speller. The program suggests text edits based on an initial sets of rules, defined in a text file and reorganizes this set based on the input from users, using a feedback loop. The output of each iteration is the vote for quality of the algorithm that brought about the desired change. That algorithm (neural network node) gets a higher priority in neural network working on the next iteration. 

Designed for dyslextics.
